# Solderparty BBQ10KBD Example

This repository contains a Zephyr driver for the [Solder Party BBQ10KBD](https://github.com/arturo182/BBQ10KBD), and a sample application using the driver.

The Zephyr driver should work with the [BBQ10Keyboard PMOD](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/bb-q10-keyboard-pmod/) and [FeatherWing](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/keyboard-featherwing-qwerty-keyboard-26-lcd/) versions.

Check the [Solder Party's official repository for the BBQ10KBD software](https://github.com/solderparty/bbq10kbd_i2c_sw) for more information about the protocol, registers and a lot more.
